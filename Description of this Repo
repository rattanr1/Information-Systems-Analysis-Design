                                                   ###### Modern Systems Analysis and Design (9th Edition) ######

I took MIS 3301 from my university and wanted to share my solutions of the problems we did in class.

I also wanted to share extra problems I did for fun to understand the output of the coding as I go.

Just wanted to show this out there, for I found these interesting to work with and useful to know.

These are, not at all, one way to solve these problems, but serve as a guide and my learning experience within the course :)
