                       ###### Modern Systems Analysis and Design (9th Edition) ######

I took MIS 3301 from my university, which covers terminology, concepts, skills, and techniques needed to effectively analyze and design business information systems.

We entirely used Microsoft Visio to draw diagrams as the Context Diagram, Level 0 and 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD), Activity, Use Case, Conceptual Data Model,
Conceptual Entity Relationship Diagram (CERD), Logical Entity Relationship Diagram (LERD), and Relational Entity Relationship Diagram (RERD). 

We also needed to contruct the Decision Table and Data Dictionary with the help of Excel, and write out the Use Case for one scenario. 

The whole system design process revolves on a hypothetical scenario with a fictional company called Information Engineering Systems Personnel (IESP), 
provided by the professor. I have uploaded the details of this to see where my diagrams are based on, and the rules governing their structures.  

I wanted to showcase my understanding within the course, and it helped me learn database design better, and the thought process behind it.
